# Study Guide for Final Exam: Introduction to Data Science with R Programming and SQL

## Vocabulary Terms and Definitions

### R Programming

1. **Vector**
   - A sequence of data elements of the same basic type. Members in a vector are called components.

2. **Data Frame**
   - A table or two-dimensional array-like structure in which each column contains values of one variable and each row contains one set of values from each column.

3. **Matrix**
   - A two-dimensional, homogeneous data structure in R, where all elements must be of the same type.

4. **List**
   - An ordered collection of objects (components), which can be of different types (numbers, strings, vectors, even lists).

5. **Function**
   - A block of code designed to perform a specific task, which can take inputs and return outputs.

6. **Factor**
   - A data structure used for fields that take only predefined, finite number of values (categorical data).

7. **Loop**
   - A control flow statement for specifying iteration, which allows code to be executed repeatedly.

8. **Conditional Statement**
   - A feature of a programming language that performs different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified boolean condition evaluates to true or false.

9. **Data Manipulation**
   - The process of changing data to make it more organized and easier to read.

10. **Plotting**
    - The act of creating a visual representation of data, such as graphs and charts.

### SQL (Structured Query Language)

1. **Database**
   - An organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.

2. **Table**
   - A collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. It consists of rows and columns.

3. **Query**
   - A request for data or information from a database table or combination of tables.

4. **Join**
   - An operation that combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

5. **Primary Key**
   - A field in a table which uniquely identifies each row/record in that table.

6. **Foreign Key**
   - A field in one table that is a primary key in another table, used to link the two tables.

7. **Index**
   - A database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table at the cost of additional storage space and increased maintenance time.

8. **Relational Integrity**
   - 
   
9. **Entity Integrity**
   - 

10. **View**
    - A virtual table in SQL, which is the result of a stored query on the data.

### Statistical Concepts

1. **Probability**
   - A measure of the likelihood that an event will occur.

2. **Random Variable**
   - A variable whose possible values are numerical outcomes of a random phenomenon.

3. **Distribution**
   - A mathematical description of the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes.

4. **Binomial Distribution**
   - A discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent experiments.

5. **Normal Distribution**
   - A continuous probability distribution that is symmetrical around its mean, indicating that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence.

6. **Uniform Distribution**
   - A type of probability distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely.
   
7. **Poison Distribution**
   - 


### Miscellaneous

1. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**
   - The general procedure of copying data from one or more sources into a destination system that represents the data differently from the source(s).

2. **Big Data**
   - Large, complex data sets that traditional data processing software cannot adequately deal with.

3. **Machine Learning**
   - A method of data analysis that automates analytical model building, allowing computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed.

4. **API (Application Programming Interface)**
   - A set of rules that allows different software entities to communicate with each other.

5. **Data Warehouse**
   - A system used for reporting and data analysis, and is considered a core component of business intelligence.
