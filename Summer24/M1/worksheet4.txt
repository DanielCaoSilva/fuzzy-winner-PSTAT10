## WORKSHEET 4

## 1 - Given the vector: x <- c(3,7,7,8,9,10,1) use the function which() to 
##     determine the index position of elements greater than ‘7’.
x <- c(3,7,7,8,9,10,1)

## 4 - FACTORS
#a) Create a vector consisting of the following elements: B, B, D, E.

#b) Convert this vector to a factor.

#c) Show the levels of this factor.

#d) Change the first level of this factor to A. 
#   (HINT: Use [ ] notation. Look up levels in RStudio help)

## 5 - LISTS
## In Lecture 2 DEMO 3, we saw the results of combining objects with different
## types. Here is the code again:
both = c("dog",3,"cat","mouse",7,12,9,"chicken")
both

## R provides an object called a list that can store different types of 
## objects without having to change their modes. Lists in R are created 
## using list() function.
## To check whether a given R object is a list, use is.list.
## Use RStudio help to find the syntax for the list function.

## Write an R program to create a list containing the elements shown in 
## the vector ‘both’.
